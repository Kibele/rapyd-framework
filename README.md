Rapyd is a PHP5 framework made to build applications/cms/backends using the CRUD pattern. 
It has been created in 2001 and rebuilt 2012 to support H-MVC and other nice stuff.

Now it's time to learn a bit more (composer, symfony, etc..). 
I'll try to rebuild it once again, using a better approach:
namespaces, composer, some robust symfony2 component, a popular orm, twig etc.
