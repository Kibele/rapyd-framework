rapyd-framework
===============

Minimalistic, Open Source, Widget based

Rapyd is a PHP5 framework made to build applications/cms/backends using CRUD pattern.
It was developed since 2001 and rebuilt 2012 to support H-MVC and other nice stuffs.

Not it's time to learn a bit more (composer, symfony, etc..).
I'll try to rebuilt it once again, this time on top of the Symfony2 Components
(like silex, laravel, and other cool php frameworks that I like)
