rapyd-framework
===============

I'm following  Fabien Potencier  to rebuilt rapyd-framework using synfony2 componets:
http://fabien.potencier.org/article/56/create-your-own-framework-on-top-of-the-symfony2-components-part-7


current test route: 
/front.php/is_leap_year/2004


##  notes ##

Probably at the end of tutorials I'll re-start rapyd from "Silex" and Not from scratch. 
But follow tutorial is more instructive.

Minimalistic, Open Source, Widget based

Rapyd is a PHP5 framework made to build applications/cms/backends using CRUD pattern.
It was developed since 2001 and rebuilt 2012 to support H-MVC and other nice stuffs.

Not it's time to learn a bit more (composer, symfony, etc..).
I'll try to rebuilt it once again, this time on top of the Symfony2 Components
(like silex, laravel, and other cool php frameworks that I like)
