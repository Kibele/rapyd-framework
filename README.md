Rapyd is a PHP5 framework made to build applications/cms/backends using the CRUD pattern. It has been created in 2001 and rebuilt 2012 to support H-MVC and other nice stuff.

Now it's time to learn a bit more (composer, symfony, etc..). I'll try to rebuild it once again, this time on top of the Symfony2 Components (just like silex, laravel, and other cool php frameworks that I like, do)
