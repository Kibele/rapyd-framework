#### Learn by Example & Documentation

There is no much documentation about Rapyd, so this demo mudule is the way to find how to make things.  
Please do not hit me, Rapyd is built on top of well-documented libraries.  
It just implement an __MVC__, with a pool of powerful CRUD __widgets__

manteined by me, you'll find documentation & duscussion forum about this project

- [Illuminate/Database](http://four.laravel.com/docs/database)  
from laravel 4, It include a DBAL, DB Schema Builder, Fluent Query Builder, and the smart Eloquent ORM  
(the base of Rapyd __Models__)

- [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/)  
basically a magnificent router, used as base of Rapyd/Application  
(a layer to implement __Controllers__ and manage modules organization)
